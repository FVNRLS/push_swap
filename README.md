**About The Project**
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

**Basic program description:**
Sorting algorithm to sort a given stack of numbers in ascending order. 
For sorting you can use only 2 stacks: Stack a and Stack b. The stack itself is a linked list. The sorting depends on the stack size (different algorithms are used).
If the stack could not be created (e.g. in case of invalid input), an error message message is returned.
Otherwise, the return are the instructions used for sorting. At the end, the two stacks are freed due to memory allocation.

Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

**Prerequisites**
➡ Installed C-Compiler like gcc, cc or clang.

**Usage**


**Roadmap**
:boom: Resolve segfault behaviour for big stack sizes on Linux machines.
